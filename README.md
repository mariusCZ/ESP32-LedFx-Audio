# ESP32-LedFx-Audio
This is a ESP32 based device which can take line level stereo audio and send it to a [LedFx](https://github.com/LedFx/LedFx) server. You can find the fork that supports this [here](https://github.com/mariusCZ/LedFx).

Without having electronics knowledge, this may be somewhat harder to set up. However, this does not use any I2S line level ADCs, because they are quite rare.
